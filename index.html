<p>Hello, are you a mechanical engineer? Have you ever heard the names FEM/FEA/Finite Element Methods etc? Have you ever wondered what is it? 
If you have, you have come to the right place. Hi, My name is Niharika and I am a mechanical engineer by training. 
In this course, we will learn the basics of the Finite Element Methods. After you finish this course, you will be able to grasp the fundamental concepts of FEM 
and understand how it is used in practical problems. </p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The finite element method is a powerful tool for analyzing wide range of engineering problems. It has got wide variety of applications ranging 
from stress and deformation analysis of buildings and aircraft structures, predicting cracks/fractures, thermal problems etc.
In this method, a complex region is discretized into small geometrical shapes. The governing relationships
and material properties are considered over these elements. These finite elements are then assembled and solved to give us the approximate behaviour
 of the continuum.</p>
 <p>There are two main motivations for learning the finite element method. One is to write a FEM solver which few people would attempt. The second is 
 to learn the method to understand how a commercial FEM solver analyzes a particular problem. This course
 is designed for this purpose. Before we dive into FEM, we will have a look on the basics of solid mechanics.</p>
